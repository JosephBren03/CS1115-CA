                <h3>Anti-Poaching</h3>
                <p>
                    There exists anti-poaching units and community-based conservation programmes
                    in Nepal which aim to protect and monitor red panda habitats. They achieve
                    this through information boards, radio broadcasting and an annual <b>International
                        Red Panda Day</b>. In Nepal, any person found guilty of killing, buying or selling
                    red panda pelts will face a fine of up to the equivalent of $1,000 USD and
                    potentially up to 10 years in jail.

                <h3>Zoos</h3>
                <p>
                    Many zoos, including Dublin Zoo, support the <i>Red Panda Network's Forest Guardian Programme</i>
                    in Nepal, which aims to monitor red panda populations and their natural habitats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent years, zoos have made great progress with red pandas in captivity. By 2015, 42 zoos across
                    Japan kept a total of <b>219</b> red pandas. By 2019, 182 zoos in Europe kept <b>407</b> red pandas.
                    Additionally, zoos across the Americas and Australia have created various breeding programmes.

            <h2>Threats</h2>
            <p>
                The global red panda population is reported to have declined by <b>50%</b>
                in the past 20 years. There may be as few as <b>2,500</b> red pandas remaining
                in the wild as the species continues to decline. The main driving factors in their
                population decline are habitat loss and poaching.

                <h3>Habitat Loss</h3>
                <p>
                    The primary threat to red pandas is the destruction of their natural habitat, due to
                    deforestation and livestock disturbances. Logging damages the environment for bamboo to grow,
                    and livestock damages the growth of bamboo by trampling. Additionally, logging removes
                    trees which red pandas use for nesting. They also face the effects of climate change.

                <h3>Diseases & Dogs</h3>
                <p>
                    Free-roaming dogs spread disease, which are deadly to red pandas. These dogs are used in
                    livestock herding and protecting from predators, but they also kill red pandas. These dogs
                    often carry several of a range of gastrointestinal parasites and spread them to red pandas.
                    Many of these viruses have an incredibly high mortality rate in red pandas.

                <h3>Poaching</h3>
                <p>
                    Red pandas are poached for their pelts and tails, mostly in China and Myanmar. Red panda skins
                    have been smuggled across the China-Myanmar border in more recent years. Often their pelts are
                    fashioned into fur caps which are sold in markets. Red pandas are also often killed when they
                    are caught in traps which are supposed to capture other wild animals.
