                <h3>Name & Classification</h3>
                <p>
                    The scientific name for red pandas is '<i lang="la">Ailurus fulgens</i>', although they
                    have many names such as "firefox" and "red-bear-cat". The name panda is said to come from
                    the Nepali word '<i lang="ne">ponya</i>,' which means 'bamboo or plant eating animal'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally, there was thought to be <em>one</em> species of red panda, however there are
                    actually <em>two</em>, <i lang="la">Ailurus fulgens</i> and
                    <i lang="la">Ailurus fulgens fulgens</i>, which primarily vary in size and weight.

                <h3>Physical Description & Behaviour</h3>
                <p>
                    The red panda is <em>slightly larger</em> and <em>heavier</em> than a house cat, with a body shape
                    somewhat similar
                    to a cat crossed with a bear. They are about 2 feet long, with a long, bushy, ringed tail. They have
                    a thick reddish-brown coat with a belly and limbs that are black. There are white markings on the
                    side
                    of their heads and above the eyes. Their heads are large and round, with a short snout and pointed
                    ears.
                    Red pandas also have a soft, wooly undercoat. They have semi-retractable claws to allow them to move
                    between trees easily and to defend themselves, aswell as a wrist bone which acts similarly to a
                    thumb
                    which they use to grasp bamboo to eat.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Red pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that tend to stay in trees. They
                    use their tails for balance and to cover themselves in winter for warmth. They are
                    active in early morning and late afternoon. They become far less active in winter,
                    where they only are active to eat. Red pandas are generally solitary creatures but
                    will join in pairs during their mating season.

                <h3>Habitat & Diet</h3>
                <p>
                    Almost <b>half</b> of the red panda's habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas where they live in
                    high-altitude temperate forests in India, Nepal, Myanmar, Bhutan and Southern China. Loss of
                    forest and bamboo has caused a steady decline in population. Their reddish-brown coat allows
                    them to blend in with the environment, where fir trees are covered in similarly coloured moss
                    and white lichen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The red panda's diet is <b>98%</b> bamboo, although they occasionally eat fruit, insects,
                    small reptiles and various other plantlife. However, they only digest 24% of the bamboo they eat.
